# SPL-Project
For my SPL Project, I chose to demonstrate a simple palindrome program in Javascript and Python. I programmed it using Replit.

I chose Javascript and Python because both are versatile programming languages used in a diverse range of industries. In order to demonstrate how both the programming languages differ, I have written a function that validates if a given string is a palindrome or not. 

## Data type
When it comes to Data types, we do not need to specify the data type of the variable. 

```javascript
var example = "example"
```
