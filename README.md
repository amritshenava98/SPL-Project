# SPL-Project
For my SPL Project, I chose to demonstrate a simple palindrome program in Javascript and Python. I programmed it using Replit.

I chose Javascript and Python because both are versatile programming languages used in a diverse range of industries. In order to demonstrate how both the programming languages differ, I have written a function that validates if a given string is a palindrome or not. 

## Data type
When it comes to Data types, we do not need to specify the data type of the variable. Javascript and Pythong will detect the variable when it is declared and initialized. However, Python has a None value for variables that does not have any value and Javascript has null for variables without any value. If a value in Javascript is declared and not initialized, it will be undefined. In python, a variable has to be initialized In Python, we use the snake_case naming convention for variables whereas in Javascript, we use the lowerCamelCase naming convention. Python has 4 primitive data types including int, float, bool and str. Javascript has 6 primitive data types including undefined, Boolean, String, Number, BigInt and Symbol.
```javascript
//javascript
var exampleVar = "example"
```
```python
#python
example_var = "example"
```

## Function and Parameter Passing
In Python, we define functions with the keyword def and use colon. In Javascript, we define functions using the keyword function and surround the block of code with curly braces. Python uses the call by object reference whereas Javascript uses both call by value and call by reference. 

```javascript
//javascript 
function testFunction(){
}
```
```python
//python
def test_function():

```
